            <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
            <p>
                During my undergraduate studies, I enhanced my self-discipline by participating in theater and archery clubs, while also developing my communication skills. Solving Sudoku and doing anti-stress coloring have become my hobbies while improving my stress management and focusing skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                In parallel with social activities, I took care to improve myself academically. By doing my internship and graduation project under the projects of my teachers, I gained research and project development skills. During my undergraduate education, I focused on remote sensing and geographic information systems. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future, I want to continue my career in disaster-land management by improving my skills in spatial data analysis and blending my knowledge of Remote Sensing and GIS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am doing my master's degree in Geoinformation and Geospatial Data Science at the University of Münster and completing the Beginner's Frontend Web Development Path of patika.dev.

            <h2><b> My Favorite Productions </b></h2>
            <p>
                In general, I like to watch adventure and supernatural series/movies. In addition to movies and TV series, animations are also productions that I enjoy watching.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recommend to everyone the ones I watched recently: Oppenheimer, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and Inside Out.
